Hello and welcome to my personal blog. I'm Davide Viccari, also known as SumZero, and I'm a Computer Science student passionate about Computer Networks and System Administration, with a particular focus on Active Directory and its underlying Windows infrastructure.

I'm also well versed in Cyber Security and have earned industry standard certifications such as [OSCP](https://www.credential.net/29a1f75a-6392-4585-9d11-98095104735c) and [CRTE](https://www.credential.net/6f57900c-95ff-4b86-83db-c677bef0dd82). This knowledge allows me to analyze network and system configurations through the the lens of an attacker, helping me set up secure environments.

I'm currently "learning the ropes" of Cloud Computing, I recently obtained the Azure AZ-900 certification and in the future I intend to improve my Azure cloud skills and especially in EntraID.

On this blog I plan to bring network and system configurations, with a focus on Active Directory, followed by posts related to both defensive and offensive Cyber Security. See you on my posts!
